            <h1>PiePacker</h1>
            <h3>An Iterative Design Project</h3>
        </div>
        <div class = "textsect">
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The iterative design project is an assignment from Brown’s CS1300 course, focused particularly on iterative design, prototyping, and usability testing. Working in a team of two, we created and iterated on designs for the UI of a start-up, conducting critque sessions and user usability testing to gain feedback and improve upon each iteration. </p>
          <h5 class = "greytitle">The Start-Up</h5>
          <p>The start-up our team chose to focus on is <a style ="color: #632CFF; text-decoration: none;" href = "https://piepacker.com/">PiePacker</a>, a free online gaming platform to hangout and play premium retro games with friends online. The user is presented with a collection of original multiplayer games, which they can play in ‘rooms’ similarly to a screen sharing in a Zoom Call. In our case, we chose to design a website interface.</p>
          <h5 class = "greytitle">The User</h5>
          <p>The user who we designed the webpage for and hope to impact are individuals who enjoy computer games and playing these games with friends, although they may not necessarily be super competitive or professional players. Our users are simply those looking to play games for entertainment with others, social interaction in their experience being a key need. We also want to assume that our users are not necessarily super tech-savvy, so we wanted our user experience to be as intuitive and easy-to-learn as possible, especially for first-time users.<br>PiePacker’s goal is to create a fun and social environment for individuals to collaborate and compete in online games, which we chose our user as an individual who is a casual gamer, social, and not necessarily super tech-savvy.</p>

        <div class = "textsect">
          <h4>Low-Fidelity Sketches</h4>
          <p>To start off our design process, we were to create four low-fidelity sketches of our webpage. However, before we could do so, we first identified the inital key pages to design: the home page, game search, login/signup, game room, game results, and settings.</p>
          <div style = "display: flex;
          flex-direction: row;
          flex-wrap: wrap;
          width: 100%;
          justify-content: center;">
          <img style = "width: 45%;" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch1.png">
          <img style = "width: 45%;" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch2.png">
          <img style = "width: 45%;" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch3.jpg">
          <img style = "width: 45%;" src="Iterative Design Images/Sketch4.jpg">
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top: -2%;">From our initial sketches, we identified the components and designs we liked the most, combining them into our mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "textsect">
          <h4>Mid-Fidelity WireFrames</h4>
          <p>Based on our initial sketches, we created low fidelity wireframes of our designs using Figma.</p>

         <div class = "textsect">
          <h4>Visual Guide</h4>
          <p>Before creating our High Fidelity Prototypes, we made a visual style guide to maintain consistency and resuable UI components across our designs.</p>
          <img style = "width: 90%;" src="Iterative Design Images/VisualGuide.jpg">

         <div class = "textsect">
          <h4>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
          <p>For our high-fidelity interactive prototypes, we made three iterations. The first iteration we took into a critique studio. After iterating upon the feedback recieved from that critique to make our second iteration, we conducted usability testing. With the usability testing feedback, we were able to improve our designs even more, resulting in our third and most recent iteration.<br>
            The third iteration is presented below.</p>

          <h4>Studio Critique</h4>
          <p>In our studio critique, we had classmates and a UX researcher from Nintendo interact with our prototype, and gained their feedback. From the session, the most helpful and common feedback points were:</p>
          <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; width: 80%; align-self: center;">
          <p>
            If we assume users have never seen or used this platform before, we have a lot of opportunity in how we can craft the experience because it is fairly untouched. <br>The key is to create a site that is very intuitive and learnable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simplify the Navigation bar so that navigating between pages is less confusing: <br>Home, Search, Messages, Account Settings
          </p>
          <p>
            The Leave Game overlay is very confusing. People did not know how to get back to the home page from the game room from the leave button because of the Leave Game overlay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, people tend to think the flow is fairly intuitive, and like the color scheme (matches Discord, Steam, and other gaming platforms).

        <div class="textsect">
          <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
          <p>With our second iteration, we conducted usability testing with three random individuals through UserTesting.com. <br>The link to the three user test videos can be found <a style ="color: #632CFF; text-decoration: none;" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15j8eVvRhsB7u_LNox1m8FX0yd86n_FW1?usp=sharing" >here</a>.</p>
          <p>
            For our usability testing, we had the users complete a series of sub-tasks to create and enter a game room:<br>
1.  Create an Account<br>
2.  Choose a game from favorite games list<br>
3.  Create a room<br>
4.  Join a game<br>
5.  Look at game Chat<br>
6.  Leave Game and Return to Home<br>
7.  Look at your chat notifications and open up the most recent conversation<br>
8.  Go to Account Settings and log out<br>
          </p>
            <div class = "row">
              <div class = "responsebox">
                <h6 class = "color" 
                  >User A</h6>
                <p >Time to complete: ~4:00 min</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">“Really nothing [was confusing]. Tasks were very easy as if it were a site I was familiar with”</p>
                <p>User A was able to complete the tasks with ease, and found the site both straightforward and intuitive. They also said they liked the purple and gray color scheme.</p>
              </div>
              <div class = "responsebox">
                <h6 class = "color" 
                 style = 
                 >User B</h6>
                 <p >Time to complete: ~9:00 min</p>
                 <p style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">“I had a hard time finding home and basically back tracking through anything.”
                </p>
                 <p>During User B’s test, they were confused by Figma’s prototype  and accidently ended up signing up for Figma. They ran into issues with going back home, although for the rest of the prototype they said it was fairly intuitive.</p>
               </div>
              <div class = "responsebox">
                <h6 class = "color" 
                 style = 
                 >User C</h6>
                 <p >Time to complete: ~3:30 min</p>
                 <p style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: italic;">“The layout of the site was very basic and did not look professional.”
                </p>
                 <p>User C was able to complete tasks relatively easily. However, when creating a room, they ran into an issue where they were unable to close the overlay, and had the restart. They also recommended making the appearance more professional.</p></div>
            </div><br>
            <p>The results of the user testing met, and even exceeded our expectations a little bit due to the positive response we recieved on usability and intuitiveness. We discovered that while our prototype was relatively intuitive and learnable, with affirming statements from all three users. However, Users B and C ran into issues with closing out the overlays. This was actually an error on our team’s end, where we did not connect the prototype correctly (accidently selected ‘navigate to’ instead of ‘swap with’ for the overlays). We also did not link the back button on the game information page, another design error on our end. 
              <br><br>User B and User C both had critical views of the appearance, with User B stating that the color was too dark and User C suggesting we make components smaller and more professional.
              <br><br>
              However, all three users gave us positive feedback in that they found the website generally simple and easy to use, which was a goal we wanted to hit for the third iteration. 
              <br><br>
              Using the feedback we recieved, we corrected the prototyping errors that users experienced. If given more time, we would definitely continue to refine the appearance of the website, making it more professional and making components more compact. However, in terms of the color scheme, that may need more research, as we have gotten a mix of both positive and negative remarks.</p>

          <div class="textsect">
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Throughout this project, our biggest takeaway was the experience we gained conducting usability testing through a professional site like Usertesting.com, as well as how to structure usability tests to best gauge results. Having fairly vague subtasks gave the users enough direction to move through the site, but also left room for them to figure things out on their own and see what issues they experienced. <br><br>We also experienced a very interesting concept during our critique studio. The Nintendo UX Researcher told us that our start-up interface was one that was relatively new, which gave us much more freedom to explore and try things out. In comparison to a check-out experience, we had much more space for creativity. However, because we were creating a relatively new product, the key question was how we could make our users understand how to use it. In other words, when dealing with new and innovative ideas, having intuitive and understandable interfaces is key to maintaining usability and minimizing confusion.</p>
